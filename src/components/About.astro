    My name is Alexandre Spindola. As a <strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong>, I specialize in building <strong>AI-Powered Automation</strong> and <strong>High-Performance Systems</strong>. I architect and implement robust, scalable, and efficient solutions that directly translate complex business challenges into tangible value.
  </p>

  <p>
    My core expertise involves creating powerful automation workflows with
    <strong>n8n</strong>, developing resilient data layers with <strong>Supabase and PostgreSQL</strong>, and building end-to-end systems. I bring these services to life with dynamic JAMstack frontends using <strong>Astro, Svelte, and Vue.js</strong>, all
    powered by versatile backends with <strong>Node.js, Deno, and Go</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a <strong>Google Associate Cloud Engineer (GCP)</strong> with an <strong>MBA in Software Engineering</strong>, I bring
    a holistic perspective to every project. My focus is on implementing robust serverless architectures and defining CI/CD pipelines, always bridging the gap between technical execution and strategic business objectives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently expanding my expertise into <strong>Go</strong> for highly concurrent, high-performance backend services and <strong>Rust</strong> for memory-safe systems programming. I'm also leveraging edge-native databases like <strong>Turso</strong> to build low-latency, globally distributed applications. Based in Madrid with <strong>full EU work authorization</strong>, I am available for challenging opportunities where I can deliver impactful solutions.

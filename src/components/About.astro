    My name is Alexandre Spindola, and I am a
    <strong>Software Architect</strong> with a passion for designing robust,
    scalable, and efficient systems. My work sits at the intersection of
    high-level system design, <strong>AI-powered automation</strong>, and the
    hands-on implementation of high-performance applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in <strong>architecting the digital backbone</strong> of modern businesses. My core expertise involves designing powerful automation ecosystems with
    <strong>n8n</strong>, creating resilient data layers with <strong>Supabase and PostgreSQL</strong>, and orchestrating end-to-end systems. I translate these architectural blueprints into reality with dynamic frontends using <strong>Astro, Svelte, and Vue.js</strong>, all
    powered by versatile backends with <strong>Node.js, Deno, and Go</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a unique background that includes a degree in
    <strong>Psychology</strong>, an <strong>MBA in Software Engineering</strong>,
    and a <strong>Google Associate Cloud Engineer (GCP)</strong> certification, I bring
    a holistic perspective to every project, bridging the gap between complex
    technical requirements and strategic business objectives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently expanding my architectural expertise into <strong>Go</strong> for designing highly concurrent, high-performance backend services and <strong>Rust</strong> for memory-safe systems programming. I'm also leveraging edge-native databases like <strong>Turso</strong> to build low-latency, globally distributed applications. Based in Madrid with <strong>full EU work authorization</strong>, I am available for challenging remote, hybrid or on-site opportunities where I can
    deliver tangible business value.

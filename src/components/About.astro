      My name is Alexandre Spindola, and I am a
      <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with a passion for architecting robust,
      scalable, and efficient solutions. My work sits at the intersection of
      backend development, system integration, and high-performance frontend
      applications.

      I specialize in building the digital backbone of modern businesses. My core
      expertise involves creating powerful automation workflows with
      <strong>n8n</strong>, designing resilient data layers with
      <strong>Supabase and PostgreSQL</strong>, and managing content through
      headless CMS like <strong>Strapi</strong>. I bring these services to life
      with dynamic frontends using <strong>Astro, Vue, and Nuxt</strong>, all
      running on versatile backends with <strong>Node.js and Deno</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a unique background that includes a degree in
      <strong>Psychology</strong>, an <strong>MBA in Software Engineering</strong>
      from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), and a
      <strong>Google Associate Cloud Engineer (GCP)</strong> certification, I bring
      a holistic perspective to every project, bridging the gap between complex
      technical requirements and strategic business objectives.
    </p>

      Currently based in Cologne, I am a Spanish citizen with full work
      authorization in the European Union. I am actively learning German and am
      available for challenging remote,hybrid or on-site opportunities where I can
      deliver tangible business value.

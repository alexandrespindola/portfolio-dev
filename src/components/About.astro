      My name is Alexandre Spindola. Based in Cologne, I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> combining an <strong>MBA and Google Cloud Platform certification</strong> with a solid track record of technical delivery. I am currently deepening my expertise in the Enterprise ecosystem through a <strong>Postgraduate Specialization in Full-Stack Development</strong>, focused on <strong>Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices Architecture</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bridge the gap between complex requirements and reliable code. My core technical foundation is built on <strong>TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js, Vue.js, Nuxt)</strong>, PostgreSQL databases, and Cloud-Native solutions. I excel in <strong>Business Process Automation (n8n)</strong> and API integrations, reducing manual operational overhead and ensuring scalable system performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a unique professional background in <strong>Banking Operations and Psychology</strong>, I bring a user-centric and compliance-aware perspective to engineering. I am experienced in <strong>L2/L3 Technical Support</strong>, handling sensitive data, and translating business needs into technical specifications. I don't just write code; I ensure solutions are maintainable, documented, and aligned with business goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am an <strong>EU Citizen (Spanish)</strong> with full work authorization, transitioning my career to the German Enterprise market. I am available for <strong>Immediate Start</strong> in <strong>Cologne (On-site)</strong> or Hybrid roles, looking for opportunities to apply my full-stack skills and operational maturity.

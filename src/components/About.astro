    My name is Alexandre Spindola. As a <strong>Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong> with MBA and Google Cloud Platform certification, I bring 3+ years of experience delivering scalable, production-ready solutions across modern technology stacks. I specialize in building <strong>websites, landing pages, web and mobile applications</strong> combined with cloud-native architectures and serverless deployments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I develop end-to-end solutions—from corporate websites to custom web applications, mobile apps, e-commerce platforms, API integrations, and business automation. My core expertise includes <strong>TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js, Bun, Deno)</strong>, PostgreSQL databases, serverless functions (Cloudflare Workers, Supabase Edge Functions), and workflow automation with <strong>n8n</strong>. I work extensively with platforms like <strong>Shopify, Magento, WordPress, Strapi, and Directus</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a <strong>Google Associate Cloud Engineer (GCP)</strong> with an <strong>MBA in Software Engineering</strong>, I bring a holistic perspective to every project. I'm skilled in system integrations, translating client requirements into technical solutions, and managing full project lifecycles autonomously. My experience spans from responsive design and SEO optimization to enterprise e-commerce integration platforms with real-time bidirectional synchronization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently expanding my expertise into <strong>Go</strong> for highly concurrent backend services and <strong>Rust</strong> for memory-safe systems programming. With <strong>full EU work authorization</strong> (Spanish citizen), I am available for challenging opportunities where I can deliver impactful full-stack solutions.

      My name is Alexandre Spindola. Based in Cologne, I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and <strong>Automation Specialist</strong> combining an <strong>MBA and Google Cloud Platform certification</strong>. I build scalable architectures by merging modern <strong>NestJS and Angular</strong> ecosystems with robust <strong>Enterprise patterns (Java/Spring foundations)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bridge the gap between code and infrastructure. My technical expertise centers on <strong>TypeScript (NestJS, Angular)</strong>, supported by <strong>Cloud Infrastructure (GCP, Docker)</strong> and self-hosted environments. I excel in <strong>Business Process Automation (n8n)</strong>, orchestrating complex workflows to reduce operational overhead and drive business efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a unique background in <strong>Psychology and Business Operations</strong>, I bring a pragmatic perspective to engineering. I focus on translating complex business requirements into <strong>reliable technical specifications</strong>. I don't just write code; I ensure solutions are based on <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, are well-documented, and deliver measurable value.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am an <strong>EU Citizen (Spanish)</strong> with full work authorization, ready for new challenges in the German market. I am available for <strong>Immediate Start</strong> in <strong>Cologne (On-site)</strong>, Hybrid, or Remote roles, offering a blend of hands-on full-stack development and strategic automation skills.
